## Requirements
To run this logo generator, you will need to have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
Copy code
npm install

## Usage
To create your own custom SVG logo, follow these steps:

Run the logo generator application by executing the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
node app.js
The application will prompt you for the following input:

Enter up to three characters for the logo.
Enter text color (keyword or hexadecimal number).
Choose a shape from circle, triangle, or square.
Enter shape color (keyword or hexadecimal number).
After providing the required input, the application will generate the SVG logo and save it as logo.svg in the project directory.

## Custom Shapes
This logo generator also allows you to use custom shapes. The project provides a Shape class and subclasses for Square, Circle, and Triangle. To use a custom shape, you can create a new instance of the desired shape class, passing the desired color as a parameter, and then call the render() method to get the corresponding SVG code snippet for that shape with the specified color.

## Tests
The project includes automated tests to verify the correctness of the custom shape classes. The tests use the Jest testing framework to ensure that the SVG code snippets are generated correctly for each shape with different colors.

To run the tests, execute the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
npm test
